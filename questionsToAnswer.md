### Martin asks: 
Ndefs are cool; how do we make an Ndef that will take a SynthDef and make it play from a Pbind? It's not obvious because a SynthDef would normally have an Out.ar() of somesort; whereas an Ndef normally should not. (Not finding clear examples, and also there's a name clash between 'gate' in Ndef and in SynthDef (something like that anyway; I'll check it out.)


### Martin asks: 
Guy's code all ends with .sc. Convention is that .sc is for classes and .scd is for sclang code. Should we in the new project stick to .scd/.sc, or use it as a way to distinguish between Guy code and Martin code? 


### Martin asks: 
I think I got nvim installed properly, and scnvim in the right place. However :healtcheck scnvim says scnvim classes are not installed. I'm a bit confused about where the config file is for scnvim and where to point to the supercollider executable.
