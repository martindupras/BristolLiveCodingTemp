### Martin asks: 
Ndefs are cool, but they put a function into a proxy; how do we make an Ndef that will take a SynthDef and maker it play from a Pbind? (Not finding clear examples, and also there's a name clash between gate in Ndef and in SynthDef (something like that anyway; I'll check it out.)


### Martin asks: 
Guy's code all ends with .sc. Convention is that .sc is for classes and .scd is for sclang code. Should we in the new project stick to .scd/.sc, or use it as a way to distinguish between Guy code and Martin code?
